# QuickBite

The project is a system for an e-commerce application that provides basic functions such as users' basket management, adding food, placing orders and user transactions.

Using the MongoDB database, users' baskets are created, updated and displayed. Users can add products to the basket, remove existing products and retrieve basket data. Foods can be added, listed or deleted from the database.

Order operations allow users to save their orders, update their status and view their past orders. User registration and login processes are supported by authentication and secure registration processes.

While React JS is preferred to create the user interface, Node.js is used as a powerful platform for server-side applications. Express.js was introduced as a minimalist framework to manage these Node.js applications. MongoDB NoSQL database was preferred for data storage. These technologies enable the project to create a secure, scalable and performance-oriented structure.
